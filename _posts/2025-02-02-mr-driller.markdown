### What is it about?

Mr. Driller is an adorable game about drilling down into colorful blocks as far as you, the player, can before your air supply runs out. There is some strategy involved in deciding which blocks to drill into as blocks are stacked onto each other and are subject to gravity. If the blocks lose their support underneath, they will come crashing down from above and possibly even squish you. The player is given 3 lives and some pockets of air supply dispersed among the blocks to aid your survival. You can even coordinate the falling blocks to connect 4 or more and clear more area at once because connections that involve 4 or more units cause the whole group to disappear. But you have to be careful if that destabilizes the sections way above you and put you in danger. 

### The advantages of emulation

Through the emulated server on the browser, the game plays fairly smoothly once I had gotten used to the controls. The only main keys are for movement with the arrow keys and to drill into a block using ctrl. On the original setup of the game, I believe a joystick and button would be used for controls and moving side to side. The joystick would have added some more difficulty to avoiding the falling blocks compared to the speed and accuracy allowed with pressing the exact directional arrow keys needed for quick movement.

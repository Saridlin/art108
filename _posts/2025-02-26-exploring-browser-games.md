Each designer approaches creating games differently and the results can still widely vary even between games within the same genre. As a student learning game design, I found several browser games to explore for short 10 minute sessions where I would try to identify key elements in the games to note down. Here are some of my findings.

### Paperclips
*Paperclips* is a simple-looking tycoon and clicker game that has the player manage a paperclip making business. It has a minimalistic and clear web interface for the player to use with a console-style log that communicates game events to the player at the top of the page. The player needs to balance the demand of their produced paperclips, the speed at which clips are produced, and the speed at which they sell to more efficiently increase the number of total paperclips made.
I really enjoyed the web design of the game and the straightforward layout. Although it looks simple, it took a good amount of time to find my best strategy to efficiently manage my paperclip output and income.

### This is the Only Level
A fairly well-known platformer game that I revisited again after more than a decade where the player controls an elephant character in an attempt to traverse a level filled with platforms and spikes to get to the level’s goal.
The core mechanic of this browser game is the mostly unchanging level design, but the rules for how the player can interact with the level design change each “stage”. The player's movement to the level goal is limited by the unique rule which is hinted at by the stage's name.

### Karnalita
*Karnalita* is also a platformer game that present the player with some clever level design and puzzling fashion. However, its style of puzzles is more logical than internet/web culture reference based like “This is the Only Level” was. It involves controlling a living pot that contains a plant which also has a sentient head that can consume fruits in the levels for points.
This game lays out its level design in a way which encourages the player to go toward the more easily accessible fruit, but to properly solve the level, the player must think through the order of their actions properly. The player’s character also had an unusual mechanic which also needed to be taken into consideration where both “heads” to the character must survive to the end of the level.

### Viewing Games with Others
As I played through various collections of browser games, I also got a chance to watch a classmate play through a game as well. Sitting as the outside spectator, while also analyzing the game, was a different experience since I could not control the player’s actions in the moment. I was able to see how my style of play differs from someone else, especially when it came to what elements of a game we would be drawn to. While observing someone else play and explore a game, I found myself thinking about what design choices in the game led my classmate to gravitate towards a certain object or visual. Then, when I played the same game myself, I wanted to do actions that I hadn’t seen attempted yet, but I also was able to immerse myself more into the narrative.

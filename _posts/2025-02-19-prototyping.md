### What is Card-Cala?

Card-Cala is a game that extends the classic [mancala](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2955/mancala) mechanic of moving and collecting stones to a more circular board. Instead of 2 goals tied to the two players, there are 4 available to all to compete for. Each goal area has points to collect and a chance at earning an extra point at times. Players still move stones across the board, but points are only earned when their last stone in a turn is able to land on one of the goals. Players are also able to choose from any pile to start their turn from and everyone plays until all the cards have been claimed and all stones used.

### Development of the Game Over Time

#### **First Play Session**
Card-Cala started as a general concept of a game that used the mancala mechanic combined with a deck of cards that would randomly determine a set of rules for players to be able to choose their next move from. A standard deck of cards would be pulled from each turn, with the card dictating the number of tiles a player can move and what color stone must be present in the pile the player picks up.
The board at this time was similar to the most well-known version of Mancala, where there were two goals and two rows of pits for stones. There were still 4 stones per pit, coming to 56 differently colored stones.

#### **Changes Made to the First Iteration**
In the first iteration, the specificity of the cards made a turn become tedious and did not allow enough agency for the player to make decisions. The suits of the card and the value were scrapped as the turn deciding mechanic.
Changes were then made to how the game was set up to try and solve some of these issues. The most major change was the board. It became a square with a goal for stones at each corner, and 4 pits for stones between each goal. There was now only one row of pits and movement was strictly done in a counter-clockwise direction. The number of stones per pit was also reduced to 3. Cards were still kept as part of the game, but they were instead used as point-values that players could aim for in each goal corner. 

#### **Second Play Session**
In the second play session, 2 players competed against each other for the points at each goal post. The cards were split into 4 piles of 12 cards each from a standard deck of cards that did not include the Aces. Each card used the value depicted as its point value, except for face card which were worth 10 points. The players strategized against each other and tried to avoid choosing piles that could possibly create opportunities for their opponent to easily earn a card. 
Players were much more engaged in the game with the changes made and enjoyed the playtest.

#### **Changes to the Second Iteration**
From the second playtest, players felt that calculating the point total was difficult due to the amount of cards that would be collected and the various point values. There was also a huge point difference between players due to the amount of high-point cards that were available to grab. As a result, the face card point value was changed to be 5 points.
Players also said that the game still felt close to the classic mancala format, even if it made the game easy to understand and pick up. So, the Aces were then brought back into play as a determiner for a “Trump Suit” which would award an extra point. A player would earn this extra point for every card picked up that shared the same suit as the chosen “Trump Ace” at the start of the game.

#### **Third Play Session**
In the third and last play session, new players approached a game similar to the second test with some minor changes. They felt that the action of picking up proper cube-tokens as the stones was a fun and engaging activity. One of the players had not played mancala-type games before, but had an easy time getting familiar with the rules even with the uniqueness of this version. 
The feedback was similar to the second paytest, however, regarding the calculation of the point totals for each player. Even with the face card values changed to 5, calculating who won still took a great portion of time. Players felt that the cards should all give 1 point, and just the “Trump suit” would award an extra point. This would still allow 1 out of every 4 cards in a pile to have a chance at being a higher valued card for players to compete for during the game.

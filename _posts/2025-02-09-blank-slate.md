This is a session report for the board game, Blank Slate, of which a description can be found on the BoardGameGeek site [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254188/blank-slate).
I played with my classmates Cassie, Alisha and Danny, and the play session took about 20 minutes since we played through rounds fairly quickly. Rounds followed the table clockwise starting with Cassie then Alisha, Daria and ending with Danny.

We started the game by choosing the color we wanted our slate colors and which direction to go around the table. Cassie started the round since she was familiar with how to play the game and explained the rules to the rest of us.
Below is a play-by-play record of each round and the point-winning guesses made. 3 points were given when only 2 players wrote down the same valid guess. 1 point was given when 3 or more players wrote down the same valid guess. To win, a player must reach a total of 25 points.

### Review

This game was quite fun and it was interesting trying to figure out which common compound word would net me the most points. At different times in the game, I had a tough time choosing between options I thought up. I also think that this game brought forward how the difference or similarity in playersâ€™ interests influenced which guesses that they would be likely to make.


I would definitely play this game again.
